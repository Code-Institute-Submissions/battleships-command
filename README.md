# Battleships Command

Battleships command is a python terminal game which runs in the Code Institute terminal on Heroku

Users can compete against the computer by correctly guessing the opponent's battleship coordinates before the computer finds theirs. The player can choose what board size and amount of ships they would like to use each game.

## How to Play

Battleship Command is based on the classic 'Battleship' game. You can learn more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game))

In this version, the player enters their name, choice of board size and number of ships for each player which then randomly generates two boards.

The player's ships can be seen, as indicated by a | sign, but cannot see the computer's ship coordinates.

Guesses are marked on the board with an X while hits are shown with an O.

The player can input a row and column to choose their next guess while the computer will randomly generate their choice, both attempting to find and sink each other's battleships.

The winner is the player who locates and sinks all of their opponent's battleships first.
